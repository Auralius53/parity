  <h1>About This Site</h1>

  <p>Although I coded this website from the ground up, I utilized the <a href="https://webring.xxiivv.com/#random" target=" _blank">XXIIVV Webring</a> and the <a href="https://www.paritybit.ca/" target="_blank">paritybit.ca</a> website as a base for this one. Lately, I've been wanting to expand upon my skills in Web design, and this is a pretty good way to increase my experience.</p>
